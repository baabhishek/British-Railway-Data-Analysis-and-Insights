This project aims to analyze railway data to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions to improve service quality, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The analysis covers various aspects including peak times, frequent traveller routes, revenue impacts due to delays, railcard benefits, and performance by departure and arrival stations.
For Customer ID, we have created a unique customer ID by combining various data points to enable comprehensive analysis.

**Project Objectives:**

-**Identify Peak Ticket Purchase Times:**
Determine the times of day with the highest ticket purchases and the impact on delays.

-**Analyze Frequent Traveler Routes:**
Identify the most frequently travelled routes and preferred payment methods.

-**Assess Revenue Loss Due to Delays and Understanding of Overall Loss:**
Calculate revenue loss due to refunds from delays and cancellations.

-**Evaluate Railcard Impacts:**
Analyze how different railcard categories affect ticket prices and delays.

-**Examine Journey Performance:**
Identify routes with significant delays and propose improvements.

-**Revenue and Ticket Price Analysis:**
Analyze revenue and average ticket price by ticket type and class.

-**Purchase Type Analysis:**
Compare online vs. station purchases over time.

**Key Insights:**

-**Peak Times and Delays:**
Morning (6-9 AM) and evening (5-8 PM) have the highest ticket purchases and delays.
Focus on increasing train frequency and improving dispatch coordination during peak hours to reduce delays.

-**Frequent Traveler Routes:**
Popular routes include Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston and Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Piccadilly.
Credit cards are the most used payment method.

-**Revenue Loss Due to Delays:**
Refunds due to delays result in a 3.53% revenue loss.
Improve punctuality and enhance operational efficiencies to minimize revenue loss and maintain customer satisfaction.

-**Impact of Railcards:**
Disabled and Senior railcard holders experience lower delays and ticket costs.
Adult railcard holders face higher delay rates despite holding railcards.

-**Journey Performance:**
Significant delays on routes like Manchester Piccadilly to Leeds.
Better performance on routes like London Euston to Birmingham New Street.

-**Revenue and Ticket Price Analysis:**
Advance Standard tickets contribute the highest revenue, indicating a preference for lower-priced tickets purchased in advance.

-**Purchase Type Analysis:**
Online purchases dominate over station purchases, particularly in recent months.

**Decisions:**

**Optimize Peak Hour Services:**
Increase train frequency and improve dispatch coordination during peak hours.
Maintain on-time performance during non-peak hours by ensuring efficient operational management.

**Enhance Popular Routes:**
Improve service quality on frequently travelled routes and offer loyalty programs for frequent travellers.
Optimize services for Adult Railcard holders who experience high delays.

**Reduce Revenue Loss Due to Delays, Traffic, & Staffing Issues:**
Improve punctuality to minimize refund requests and maintain customer satisfaction.
Resolve staffing issues to ensure optimal operational capacity.
Address operational inefficiencies to enhance overall service reliability.

**Prioritize Routes with Massive Delays:**
Focus on resolving operational and staffing issues on routes with significant delays, such as Manchester Piccadilly to Leeds.
Implement targeted strategies to enhance punctuality and service reliability on these critical routes, preventing travellers from diverting to other modes of travel.
